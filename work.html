              This was the latest project I worked on, while studying with SheCodes. 
              It was made using React, an API, advanced HTML and CSS. It also was made using Github, Bootstrap, the Windows Visual Code Editor, as well as being hosted on Netlify.
              The idea was to create an online dictionary, that would give multiple definitions, as well as exemples and pictures related to the word search.
              It was a very fun last project, which made me dive deeper into React and solve different issues than in the other previous React project I worked in. 
              For example; the phonetics button was something I had never worked on before and was definitely a challenge which I overcame.

            <p class="text-muted">
              The React Weather App was the very first React project I worked on, while styding with SheCodes. The objective was to create a weather app, that would work like all others. 
            If you allow it, it'll search for the weather in your area using an API and it would display it to you. 
            You can also enter a city of your choosing and the app will display the weather of the searched city to you. 
            The app is also able to convert Degrees Centigrade to Fahrenheit or the other way around, it also displays a forecast for the next coming hours. 
            The challenge here was connecting to the API, so that the information displayed would be accurate but also so that the icons would change depending on the weather.

                This website was built for a client, using the Wix tools, this client wanted to showcase her skills and services.
                Which are all in the field of maternal competencies, the journey of pregnancy and childbirth.
                My client was also wanting to receive donations and payments for services via this platform. 
                The key here was not only creating a platform, that was user friendly but also one where coding was not at the forefront, so the client would also be able to go in and make changes herself when necessary.
